DNSRootStats: Analyzing DNS Traffic on Root Servers based on RSSAC002

# Project Description 
"DNSRootStats" is a script designed to analyze DNS traffic on Root Servers using the RSSAC002 metrics. By leveraging the RSSAC002 data, this script provides valuable insights into the DNS traffic patterns, trends, and metrics observed at the root server level. The script aggregates and analyzes the query volumes, query types, and geographical distribution of DNS queries to help understand the load distribution and performance of the root server system. With "DNSRootStats," you can gain a deeper understanding of the DNS traffic.
